# Bounce2


The android implementation of the request simulation.
Things that are done: 
     A probable view of how it would function is provided with help of a newly introduced button is provided, clicking which 
     the simulation would start up.
Things that are NOT Done:
     No actual map implmentation has been done as the idea is not focussed on that rather the look and the required part.
